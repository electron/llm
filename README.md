# @electron/llm

This module makes it easy for developers to build local-first applications interacting with large language models (LLMs).

# Testing

Tests are implemented using [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/). To run the tests, use the following commands:

```bash
# Run tests once
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (useful during development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```
